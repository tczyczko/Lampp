Above is link to code for HOWTO set scenes after different button combinations are pushed OR on startup when file information is read.

Have to figure out how to write and read startup and matrix information.






when looking at selected elements of 3d graphs:

1. when zooming out of range of a piece, the program resets number of piece to be shown as 1 BUT button still shows last number. Reset button number. --- zooming back in reshows piece. what is logical? - fixed.
2. Show 1 of xxx on button for number of pieces showing. - fixed
Do Not reset pieces showing when doing row/col ops OR have (secret?) button that will not show any piece that intersects bounding box. - not logical?

a. add option to store matrix as A, B or C
b. add option to get transpose
c. add option to get inverse
d. add option to replace M (showing matrix) with MA, MB or MC
e. add option to replace M with AM, BM or CM
f. add option to calculate determinant and send to edit pane
g. add option to multiply M by scalar in edit pane ? necessary ?

3. find out how to set persistent traits (write to disk?) and write matrix files in LaTeX format so user may access them. - lamppdata.txt file now  added to keep persistance of user information. Same classes and methods will be used for simple matrix IO

4. plot polynomials

Exercises 4.1
1. Choose three points from the following list and find a 2 degree polynomial
to fit them (as in the example). Do the same for a different set of three
points. What can you say about the two equations? (Hint: It is possible to
plot polynomials using Lampp. Either middle click the mouse icon at the
bottom right or down-swipe it. This will activate the polynomial plotter for
the Graph panel. Select the use of columns by right-clicking or tapping the
row-or-column toggle button near the top right. Then select the column
of values you wish to use as the coefficients for the polynomial in a single
indeterminate x you wish to graph.)

(2, 5)
(4, 2)
(6, 2)


5. Multiply matrices

Exercise 4.2.4
  {HINT}: There is an undocumented (until now) feature in Lampp which allows Lampp to do quick multiplication of matrices. First, create a matrix $A$ and populate it with the desired entries. Then press the $B$ button on the bottom left.   Accept the option to switch with $A$. Then create a matrix $B$ and populate it with the desired entries. Now, swipe down (or middle-button-click) on the mouse icon at the bottom right corner. This activates the matrix Multiply options in the Matrix panel. Bring up the Matrix panel and select the button to multiply $A$ with $B$ and send the result to $C$. Note that the order of multiplication is given as $AB=C$. To get $BA=C$, you only need to select the appropriate button. After multiplication, the resultant matrix $C$ is automatically displayed.)
