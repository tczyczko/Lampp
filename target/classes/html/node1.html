Preface
</h1>

<p>

This text is intended to be suitable as an introduction to linear algebra
for senior high school and community college students and for those people who desire to
learn about the subject but have been away from formal education for awhile.
Knowledge of calculus and analytic geometry is not assumed.

<p>
Linear algebra<a name="92" style="color: #FFFF66"></a> is easily defined as the study of
 <b>linear transformations</b>
 and <b>vector spaces</b>. This text and its accompanying software package,
 called <b>Lampp</b>,
 were designed to help students understand what linear transformations and 
vectors spaces are, as these concepts are not so easily defined.
 The emphasis is on applications but great attention is paid to proof as 
the intention is to allow accommodation without compromise of rigor.

<p>
The exercises in this text are divided into two sections,
 the mandatory (featuring proofs, derivations and <i>problems</i>, which 
must be accomplished with pen, paper and thought) and the optional 
(composed of application <i>exercises</i> which can be facilitated by the 
use of the computer). Answers to selected problems and 
exercises are given in separate sections near the end of the text.

<p>
The text of this book stands alone but is best used in conjunction
with Lampp<a name="100" style="color: #FFFF66"></a> (Linear Algebra Matrix Practice Program)and other software
designed to help students solve problems and discover the structure
of theorems. The Lampp software can be run as a standalone
application and versions are available for most operating systems.

<p>
Fields and number systems are not traditionally taught until
university. It is hoped that an earlier acquaintance with these
concepts will allow teachers to help students view  
number systems other than the <b>reals</b> in an intuitive manner.
The experience and familiarity gained should
naturally motivate a desire for further understanding. 

<p>
The traditional cross product is eschewed in favor of the outer product
and the geometric product. This was
done to introduce the concepts of <b>geometric algebra</b><a name="103" style="color: #FFFF66"></a>.
Geometric algebra is a modern approach to mathematical thinking based on the
works of Hermann Grassman (1809-1877) and William Kingdon Clifford (1845-1879). 
David Hestenes is the foremost proponent of this mathematical
tool and deserves much praise. It is very unlikely that anyone involved in a future
study of linear algebra, differential geometry, projective geometry, vector calculus, tensor
analysis, Lie algebra, algebraic geometry, quaternions, complex analysis, 3D modelling 
or advanced physics will <i>not</i> become acquainted with geometric algebra. 

<p>
The use of set theory and set notation is minimized in this text as such important concepts are
best left to more advanced treatments.  <br>

<p>
<b><big class="large">The use of Lampp with this text:</big></b>
<br>
<br>
Gauss<a name="110" style="color: #FFFF66"></a> was said to recall tables of logarithms because 
it was easier than getting out of his chair to walk across the 
room to get a book. While this is usually held as an example of 
his remarkable mental prowess, it also seems to show that even 
he would have used a book
 if it had been closer to hand. It 
is hoped that the use of Lampp will be like bringing the book<a name="tex2html1" style="color: #FFFF66"
  href="footnode.html#foot111"><sup><span class="arabic">0</span>.<span class="arabic">1</span></sup></a> closer to hand, freeing the student from mundane, error-prone 
calculations while allowing them to concentrate on familiarizing 
themselves with the power of the fundamental concepts of linear 
algebra.

<p>
There are many very good programs already
 available for solving
 systems of equations. However, few were designed
as teaching aids and those that were emulate fields
with the use of floating point numbers, which is an extra level
of abstraction which can be avoided.

<p>
Lampp was written in such a way that
 it is impossible to use correctly if one does not understand
 what fields and row  operations are. The user begins  by first
 choosing a predefined field. A matrix of up to 10 by 10 
scalars may then be created and the user is allowed to choose 
which row (or column) operations they wish to perform upon the 
matrix. Multiplication and addition of field scalars are then 
facilitated. Predefined fields include Rational numbers, Gaussian (complex 
with rational coefficients) and Integers modulo a prime. Matrix multiplication and 
addition are accomplished by showing every intermediate step so 
that a student (or instructor) may check a problem worked out 
by hand. 

<p>
For those who wish to modify Lampp (by adding other fields, for
instance) the JavaFX source code is available from the
author's Web site. The source code is distributed following
the GNU copyleft convention. Lampp has been tested extensively
with the exercises in this book but comes with
no guarantee.
