Introduction - 
<br>
The subject of linear algebra</a>
</h1>

<p>
Learning to do arithmetic was a great accomplishment for mankind as
well as for every person who struggled with it. Adding, subtracting, 
learning multiplication tables and applying this hard-won knowledge to
division were milestones in personal achievement. Certainly very few
adults regret the efforts that they were encouraged to put forth to
attain these skills as children. The utility of arithmetic is evident
even in an age (maybe even especially in an age) of hand-held calculators
and user-friendly software packages.

<p>
The next great milestone was the concept of representation of arbitrary 
numbers by symbols. We learn to use symbols like <span class="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="71" HEIGHT="29" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img26.gif"
 ALT="$ a,b,c,y,z$"></span>
 and , of
 course, the ubiquitous <span class="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img27.gif"
 ALT="$ x$"></span>
, to stand for unknown quantities in arithmetical
expressions. Instead of <span class="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="69" HEIGHT="28" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img28.gif"
 ALT="$ 1+1=2$"></span>
, we now have <span class="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="69" HEIGHT="28" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img29.gif"
 ALT="$ a+1=2$"></span>
, so what is <span class="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img30.gif"
 ALT="$ a$"></span>
?
We refer to these unknown quantities as <span  class="textbf">variables</span>.

<p>
This is the discovery of <span  class="textbf">algebra</span><a name="125"></a>. It is the use of letters to
stand for numbers in arithmetical and other mathematical statements.

<p>
Another great invention is <span  class="textbf">geometry</span><a name="127"></a>. 
 In this study we learn to
 manipulate the concepts of <span  class="textbf">points</span> and <span  class="textbf">lines</span>. 
 When we merge the ideas of geometry with algebra we are proceeding into an
 area known as <span  class="textbf">analytic geometry</span><a name="131"></a>. 
 A review of some of the concepts of analytic geometry used in this text 
will be given in the first chapter.

<p>
<p>
<span  class="textbf"><big class="LARGE">A Brief History of Linear Algebra</big></span>
<p>
Although many of the mathematical ideas which are embraced by
linear algebra have been used by mathematicians for centuries
the name itself is fairly recent. Most of the development has
taken place since the mid 1800's from attempts to
discover general methods to solve systems of linear equations.

<p>
Curiously most efforts were originally centered around the
study of <span  class="textbf">determinants</span><a name="134"></a>. This concept (which usually isn't encountered
until well into most modern studies of linear algebra)
 was developed by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz<a name="135"></a>
in 1693. Gabriel Cramer<a name="136"></a> further developed this notion, along with
Joseph-Louis Lagrange<a name="137"></a>, Carl Friedrich Gauss<a name="138"></a> and others.

<p>
In 1850, James Joseph Sylvester<a name="139"></a> used the term <span  class="textbf">matrix</span><a name="141"></a> to
designate a rectangular array (table) of numbers. These were used
to calculate determinants<a name="142"></a>. Sir Arthur Cayley<a name="143"></a>, in 1855, made discoveries
involving matrix algebra and made the very prophetic remark:

<p>
<blockquote>
There would be many things to say about this theory of matrices
which should, it seems to me, precede the theory of determinants.

</blockquote>

<p>
At nearly the same time, William Rowan Hamilton<a name="146"></a> also used the algebra of
matrices to study linear and <span  class="textbf">vector</span><a name="148"></a> functions. Vectors<a name="149"></a>, which
can be thought of as ordered lists of numbers, were first used to
define physical quantities (like force and velocity) which had
magnitude and direction. One needed two numbers to represent
such values. For example, a velocity vector written as
<span class="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="49" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img31.gif"
 ALT="$ (12,\pi)$"></span>
 could mean that we are going <span class="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img32.gif"
 ALT="$ 12$"></span>
 kilometers per hour in
direction <span class="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img33.gif"
 ALT="$ \pi$"></span>
 (which usually means directly to the left. We'll learn
about <span  class="textbf">radian</span><a name="151"></a> coordinates in a later chapter.)  

<p>
During this same period, a little known German schoolteacher named Hermann Gunther Grassmann also
did much work in the field of linear algebra, proving many theorems (one of which was named
after a mathematician who published it 26 years after Grassman's death). His work on the
connections between algebra and geometry are only now being generally recognized for their beauty
and utility.

<p>
Linear algebra is still very much a lively area of research and its use in 
other types of mathematics, economics, social sciences, physics, chemistry
and computer science seems to expand and grow daily.
